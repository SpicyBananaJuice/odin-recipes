    <h2>Description</h2>

    <p>Fried chicken, also known as Southern fried chicken is a dish consisting of chicken pieces that have been coated with seasoned flour or batter and pan-fried, deep fried, pressure fried, or air fried. The breading adds a crisp coating or crust to the exterior of the chicken while retaining juices in the meat.</p>

    <h3>Ingredients needed:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>5 cups vegetable oil for frying, or as needed</li>

    <ol>
        <li>Heat 2 inches of oil in a deep saucepan over medium heat. Place cornstarch in a bowl.</li>
        <li>Slice chicken into 1/2-inch thick pieces. Transfer to a bowl and mix with salt, garlic powder, black pepper, and cayenne.</li>
        <li>Divide chicken into 2 or 3 portions and dredge in cornstarch until evenly coated and all white; add more cornstarch if necessary.</li>
        <li>Lower chicken carefully into the hot oil in batches. Fry until crispy on the outside and no longer pink in the center, about 1 minute per side. Transfer to a paper towel-lined plate to drain. Serve hot.</li>
